How to Run:
When the program pops up, the user should enter a number between 1-5 depending on what they want to do in the console. It is important to note that the user cannot move foward until they have created a character, that is, by entering the number 1. User can then create their character by entering their character's name, character's class, and the base stats. From here the user can look at their stats, calculate their combat ratings, and level up their character.

No bonus feautures were implemented.

There is a limitation/bug in the combat ratings section as I struggled using a for loop, so I opted for simply desplaying the ratings.

Reflection:
The most challening part was getting the combat ratings and level to display correctly. At first they were displaying large numbers, which were dead values. I fixed this by setting them equal to zero when I declared these variables.
